The OSM database for Arctic Web Map is automatically updated to receive updates every minute from the master OSM database. We ([GeoSensorWeb Lab](http://sensorweb.geomatics.ucalgary.ca)) aim to have these updates applied within 10 minutes. The AWM OSM database is completely re-indexed every six months to maintain index performance (and thus tile rendering speed).

Updates to the stylesheet are merged at my (James Badger @openfirmware) discretion on the [AWM Style Repository](https://github.com/GeoSensorWebLab/awm-styles). These updates are then deployed to the AWM server and the tiel rendering service is then restarted to receive the new update. If necessary I (James Badger) will manually purge stale tiles that exhibit rendering issues to force a redraw by the tile server.
